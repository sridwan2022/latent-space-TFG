                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    This research focuses on generating photo-realistic talking face videos by leveraging on semantic facial attributes 
                    in a latent space and capturing the talking style from an old video of a speaker. We formulate a process to manipulate 
                    facial attributes in the latent space by identifying semantic facial directions. We develop a deep learning 
                    pipeline to learn the correlation between the audio and the corresponding video frames from a reference video of 
                    a speaker in an aligned latent space. This correlation is used to navigate a static face image into frames of 
                    a talking face video, which is moderated by two carefully constructed loss functions, for accurate lip synchronization 
                    and photo-realistic video reconstruction. By combining these techniques, we aim to generate high-quality talking face 
                    videos that are visually realistic and synchronized with the provided audio input. Our results were evaluated against 
                    some state-of-the-art techniques on talking face generation, and we have recorded significant improvements in the image 
                    quality of the generated talking face video.

                            The good is oft interred with their bones;<br>
                            So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br>
                            Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:<br>
                            If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br>
                            And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.<br>

            <h2>The Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                Our proposed method consists of three encoders that encodes the audio, 
                image and video inputs into 512-dimensional latent codes respectively. 
                The latent codes are combined in the latent space and pass to the generator to produce realistic talking face.

                    <p>
                        Our specific contributions are summarized as follows:

                        <li>
                            We formulate an algorithm to get semantic facial attributes in a latent space. 
                            These attributes could be mouth direction in the latent, such that it can be added to 
                            any arbitrary latent code (representing a particular face) to give a new latent code 
                            that will generate the same face with the mouth open or closed based on the magnitude 
                            of the manipulation.

                        <li>
                            We utilize the old video of a speaker to capture their talking style by learning the correlation 
                            between their speech segments and visual facial styles in an aligned latent space.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We propose an end-to-end deep learning pipeline to detect motion directions from consecutive frames 
                            of a reference video in the form of motion latent variables, and use the variables to navigate the 
                            latent code of a static face image into frames of a talking face video.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We device two learning schemes that handles accurate lip synchronization using the audio input and 
                            photo-realistic video reconstruction using the video reference.
